# Simple Calculator in Python

A simple **GUI-based calculator** created using Python's `Tkinter` library. This calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Clear Function**: Clears the input field to reset the calculator.
- **Equal Function**: Computes the result of the entered arithmetic expression.
- **Graphical Interface**: The calculator has a user-friendly interface built using the `Tkinter` library.

## Prerequisites

You will need Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Run
